      <h2>Photography & Videography</h2>
      <p>Although I don't go out and take photoes or make short movies as much I'd want to, it is still one of my
        passions. Many don't know this about me but I was strongly considering going to film school. I hope to start
        getting out more to take photos and film short movies like I did back in high School, this time with the
        beautiful streets of Chicago to play in.</p>
      <p>My go-to cameras</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Canon Rebel SL1</li>
        <li>Gopro Hero 5 Session</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Video Games</h2>
      <p>I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I started out playing on the orginal Play
        Station, and have playd on a consle from every generation since. My favorite console of all time probably has
        to be the Nintendo Game Cube, mostly for the nostalgia. I mostly play consloe games but plan on buiding a
        gaming pc in the near future. I love how video games can give you an escape from real life, and I think I
        appreciate that now more than ever.</p>
      <p>Some of my all time favorite games:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Need for Speed: Most Wanted</li>
        <li>MineCraft</li>
        <li>Spider-Man 2</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Grand Theft Auto 5</li>
        <li>Wii Sports/ Wii Sports Resort</li>
        <li>The Sims 3</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If I had to choose Red Dead Redemption 2 (video above) would be my game of the year.</p>
